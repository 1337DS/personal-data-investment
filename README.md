Investing your personal data and let it work for you

## Concept
### Problem
A big issue in the german data-science community is the data protection regulations, especially when it comes to healthcare data.
While more than 50 percent of people would agree donate or sell their personal data[<sup>1<sup>](https://www.businessinsider.de/wirtschaft/datenschutz-die-eigenen-daten-spenden-oder-verkaufen/ "Quelle: Business Insider"), there is simply no way to do this at the moment. 
However, without data there's no data science and many projects that can potentially improve healthcare and save lifes can not be realized.

### Solution
The Idea to solve this problem - and at the same time not completely loose control of your data to a intransparent company -  is to create a fund.
Everyone who decides to participate, 'pays' with his personal data and gets a share of the fund in return.
As the number of participants grow, the dataset becomes more valuable and each share will have a higher value. This will motivate participants to invite their friends and family to join.

Upon enrollment, every shareholder can decide what he wants his data to be used for, eg. only research, governemntal programs or commercial programs.
These settings can be changed anytime and will place the shareholder and his data in a database of people who chose the same preferences.

### Benefits
If now a large institution or company needs access to a large dataset, they will pay the fund for providing the private data.
This revenue can be paid to the shareholders as a dividend or be reinvested for advertising, infrastructure and security.

An additional benefit for participants would be the possiblity to be a beta-tester in the applications that will be created.
  
For expample, if a company tried to predict the occcurance of a disease based on lifestyle and genetic predisposition, 
you'd be able to see the preliminary result and your personal risk of getting sick, years before the research has been peer-reviewed, approved, commercialised and made publicly available. <br /> 
    
Wouldn't that be amazing ?
